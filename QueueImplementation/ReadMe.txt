Readme for Blackjack

This is my queue implementation of the Blackjack program.

It is run in the shell by compiling Queue.java, Blackjack.java, and UserInterface.java, 
Run with UserInterface, with command line prompts to play the game.

This version uses a queue to shuffle and hold the cards, as cards are drawn they are
sent to the back of the queue, when the dealer has made it halfway through the 
queue the deck is shuffled.

After a game has ended the cards are handed back to the dealer to be placed at 
the bottom of the deck.
