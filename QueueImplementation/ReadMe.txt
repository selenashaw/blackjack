Readme for Blackjack

This is my queue implementation of the Blackjack program.

It is run in the shell by compiling Blackjack.java and UserInterface.java, run with UserInterface.java, with command line prompts to play the game.

Update this once finished with the queue VVV
//This version randomly picks a card out of a deck each time a card is drawn, i.e. assumes the dealer shuffles each time a card is drawn.
